## Context


## Key things we are designing for
- the ability to create a basic gov.uk style form
- the ability to use what already exists in XGov Digital Form builder to: manage forms including, creating, finding existing forms, and deleting forms

<br>
Below are the screens a form creator will see when making or editing their forms.

## Versions of the journey to finding an existing form that we have tested

### Version 2
#### Onboarding landing page

<br> *Page with “journey paths for creating an account signing into Defra forms” *

#### Onboarding - email addresss
![sign-in screen 2](/app/design/assets/sign-in-email-v2.jpeg)
<br> *Page with “an email input box” *

#### Onboarding - enter code page
![sign-in screen 3](/app/design/assets/sign-in-code-v2.jpeg)
<br> *Page with “an input box for users to type the code they receieved by email” *

#### Forms library

<br> *Page with “a table that allows users to find a form by scanning their meta data” *

## What we learned

- as defra forms will be specific to Defra users, there won't be a need straight away to ask users to manually create and sign into an account.
- it will be much more feasible and a more pleasant experience for people opening Defra forms on a daily basis to utilise single sign on processes for authentication.
- having the details about who created and last edited a form was found to be benificial to ensuring correct ownership and logging of activity. However, users found it difficult to find forms a list that very long and without any form of filtering

### Version 1
#### Form designer landing page

![XGov find an existing form journey screenshot 1](/app/design/assets/xgov-as-is-existing-forms1.jpeg)
<br> *Page with “Create a new form and open an existing form as options” *

<br>

### Form designer existing forms list

## What we learned

The following gaps were identified:
- users need the ability find a forms according to who they were created by, the status of the form, date of form creation, last edited by in order to find forms from a list that could potentially been in the hundreds
- Anyone could access the forms which could pose security and data protections risks.

## Opportunities

> Are there any opportunities we would like to explore, or ideas that we think we could consider?  
> List these here. They do not have to be full formulated at this point, but will inform our work (and should be added to Trello to discuss and ideate as a team).
