# Finding forms

## Contents

## Context


## Key things we are designing for
- the ability to create a basic gov.uk style form
- the ability to use what already exists in XGov Digital Form builder to: manage forms including, creating, finding existing forms, and deleting forms

<br>
Below are the screens a form creator will see when making or editing their forms.

## Versions of the journey to finding an existing form that we have tested
### Version 1
#### Form designer landing page

<br> *Page with “Create a new form and open an existing form as options” *

<br>

### Form designer existing forms list

## What we learned

The following gaps were identified:
- users need the ability find a forms according to who they were created by, the status of the form, date of form creation, last edited by in order to find forms from a list that could potentially been in the hundreds
- Anyone could access the forms which could pose security and data protections risks.

## Opportunities

> Are there any opportunities we would like to explore, or ideas that we think we could consider?  
> List these here. They do not have to be full formulated at this point, but will inform our work (and should be added to Trello to discuss and ideate as a team).
