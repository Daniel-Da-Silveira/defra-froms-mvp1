# Form statuses

## Key things we are designing for
- showing the status of forms so that I can track its progress

<br>

## Versions of the journey to finding an existing form that we have tested

### Version 3

#### Forms statuses

<br> *Statuses in the context of form library*


![form status tag in form editor pages v3](/app/design/assets/form-editor-status.svg)
<br> *Shows a form editor page with a form status above the H1*

<br>


<br>

## What we learned
- as a minimum viable product, this version had the most positive feedback in terms of meeting the core need of finding forms quickly
- future iteration should consider a search function to enable users to find forms even faster using keywords
- an update is needed to use the recently released versions of the [GovUK tag component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag/)

<br>


### Version 2

#### Forms statuses
![form status tags v2](/app/design/assets/statuses-v2.svg)
<br> *Statuses: Published (is live on GOV.UK), Review (is being reviewed), Draft (is currently being iterated), Testing (is being tested internally or externally), Archived (is no longer being worked on and isn't published), Withdrawn (has been removed off live domains)*

<br> *Statuses in the context of form editions*

<br>

## What we learned
- the tag component wasn't up to date with the latest version in the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag/) i.e., colours were slightly different and were all in uppercase
- a need for a 'preview' tag for when previewing a form either as a form editor or someone that has been sent a link to a prototype/form is something we need for MVP

<br>

### Version 1 

![XGov find an existing form journey screenshot 1](/app/design/assets/status-v1.svg)
<br> *Page that shows the first iteration of statuses we considered: Admin (can manage users, can manage forms, can review and manage submissions, can configure global settings‚Äù*

## What we learned

- the number of roles proposed was deemed out of scope for MVP and it was decided that we'd slim down our approach in MVP so that the role needed would grow when there is need to do so.
